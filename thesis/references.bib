abstract = {We classify generalized Camassa–Holm-type equations which possess infinite hierarchies of higher symmetries. We show that the obtained equations can be treated as negative flows of integrable quasi-linear scalar evolution equations of orders 2, 3 and 5. We present the corresponding Lax representations or linearization transformations for these equations. Some of the obtained equations seem to be new.}

The equation is used to study a nonlinear instability in the director field of a nematic liquid crystal. It is shown that smooth solutions of the asymptotic equation break down in finite time. Also constructed are weak solutions of the equation that are continuous despite the fact that their spatial derivative blows up.},

abstract = {We show that the nonlinear partial differential equation, (ut+uux)xx=1/2(ux2)x, is a completely integrable, bi-variational, bi-Hamiltonian system. The corresponding equation for w=uxx belongs to the Harry Dym hierarchy. This equation arises in two different physical contexts in two nonequivalent variational forms. It describes the propagation of weakly nonlinear orientation waves in a massive nematic liquid crystal director field, and it is the high-frequency limit of the Camassa-Holm equation, which is an integrable model equation for shallow water waves. Using the bi-Hamiltonian structure, we derive a recursion operator, a Lax pair, and an infinite family commuting Hamiltonian flows, together with the associated conservation laws. We also give the transformation to action-angle coordinates. Smooth solutions of the partial differential equation break down because their derivative blows up in finite time. Nevertheless, the Hamiltonian structure and complete integrability appear to remain valid globally in time, even after smooth solutions break down. We show this fact explicitly for finite dimensional invariant manifolds consisting of conservative piecewise linear solutions. We compute the bi-Hamiltonian structure on this invariant manifold which is obtained by restricting the bi-Hamiltonian structure of the partial differential equation.}

      abstract = {We present a new integrable partial differential equation found by Vladimir Novikov. Like the Camassa–Holm and Degasperis–Procesi equations, this new equation admits peaked soliton (peakon) solutions, but it has nonlinear terms that are cubic, rather than quadratic. We give a matrix Lax pair for V Novikov's equation, and show how it is related by a reciprocal transformation to a negative flow in the Sawada–Kotera hierarchy. Infinitely many conserved quantities are found, as well as a bi-Hamiltonian structure. The latter is used to obtain the Hamiltonian form of the finite-dimensional system for the interaction of N peakons, and the two-body dynamics (N = 2) is explicitly integrated. Finally, all of this is compared with some analogous results for another cubic peakon equation derived by Zhijun Qiao.}
